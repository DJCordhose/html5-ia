For chapter 9 you'll find two versions of the WebGL engine.
1. gl_engine = 'A completed working example of the entire chapter. Meant as a companion to chapter 9.';
2. gl_eninge_blank = 'Includes a completed copy of the engine without and run.js code, so you can fill
it with whatever you like.';

To run gl_engine:
1. Navigate to the root.
2. Load up index.html and you should be good to go (Chrome recommended)

To run gl_eninge_blank:
1. Navigate to root->js->run.js
2. Fill it out with your WebGL objects, setup your engine, and anything else you need to do.
3. Navigate to root->index.html and run the file. All should work as expected (Chrome recommended).

NOTE: If you aren't seeing any WebGL in Chrome try another computer with a better graphics card.
Reason being graphics cards released in the past couple years are the only GPUs with the necessary drivers.
